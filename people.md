### Pelle van Dijk

Pelle van Dijk is a PhD researcher at the European University Institute in Florence (2017-2022). He is currently finishing his thesis focusing on the cooperation between the League’s Information Section and the League of Nations societies, the civil society organisations promoting the League in the member states. Looking at the activities of these various actors, he studies how the League had an active role in promoting moral disarmament. Using his case studies on India, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States, he shows how League officials and supporters tried to anchor both the League’s ideals as the institution itself firmly in the international world order.  Previously, he completed his BA and MA (2016) at the University of Amsterdam, where he studied interwar Dutch public diplomacy.
