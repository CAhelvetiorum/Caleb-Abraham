# The Archives of Intellectual Cooperation

The archives of intellectual cooperation consist of two very complementary documentary sets: **the archives of the Committee (ICIC)**, kept in Geneva within the League of Nations archives, and **the archives of the Institute (IIIC)**, kept in Paris within the UNESCO archives. The two collections also contain preparatory documents several years prior to the creation of these two entities, from 1919 for the Committee (although it did not begin its activities until 1922), and from 1924 for the Institute (inaugurated in 1926). It is not uncommon for documents or their copies to appear simultaneously in both collections.

These two collections have recently been fully digitized and are now available online.
