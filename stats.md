# Statistics

Some statistics about the content of the [bibliography](https://intellectualcooperation.org/publications). 

In preparation for the centennial conference, Martin Grandjean has attempted to index as many publications as possible dealing with intellectual cooperation. This effort is necessarily imperfect, but it is a first step towards a historiography of this field. 

As of May 1, 2022, the bibliography contains 320 references, of which 274 are after 1945. Among these, 225 have been identified as explicitly dealing with intellectual cooperation, and are the subject of the statistics below.
