| Reverendissimo in Christo patri, et illustrissimo domino domino Alfonso de Aragonia archiepiscopo cesaragustanensis dignissimo: subditus Guillermus Goris, post devotissima manuum oscula se humilime commendat. Non sum nescius Reverendissime in Christo pater illustrissima prosapia natus: a tuo generali vicario, tui concitatione admonitum fuisse ut aliquid de meis moralibus studiolis pro tua dignitate scriberem. Nec ita preceptorum tuorum oblitus fui ut si diu scribendo cessaverim tue dignitati inobediens videret. Sed quod si cicius scripsissem illud satis diligenter non fecissem. Quodquod etiam facere constitueram: tum diuturnitate temporis: tum propria carens patria, in aliud tempus diferendum fore existimavi. Verumtamen cum nonnullis theologica Scoti doctrina non immerito subtilis et obscura videretur. Idcirco nedum eorum vulitas cui natura nos favere iubet: verum etiam tuorum preceptorum alta recordatio me admonuit ut pro fugata negligentia diucius non sustinerem: quin si non in uno scribendi genere saltem in alio illorum utilitati subvenirem: tueque excellenti dignitati obtemperarem, obquam rem doctrinam illam veluti aquam ab obscuro et centro terre proximo puteo exhauriendam: et in alium non profundum puteolum luculenter transferendam decrevi. Ipsamque divino munere sumulatim peractam: tibi reverendissimo et illustrissimo pontifici mitto: quam vellem sic legas: ut eam tenuem et inopem nec scriptione magnopere dignam iudices. Ego enim ut tuis preceptis morem geram: ad te mittere volui istud munusculum veluti vilis vestis crasso filo sermonis contextum: cujusmodi mea solent esse munera. Spero equidem tuam archiepiscopalem atque regalem dignitatem quam fortem, justam, severam, gravem magnanimam, largam, beneficam et liberalem omnes mortalium iudicant, non juste detrabentium (si qui sint) infamare injuriam. Nec erit preterea quod isti magnopere culpare possint, si tua ingens studiorum insectatio: quid(?) crassum invenerit castigaverit. Sinvero cuipiam  aliqua in ipso opusculo videbuntur obscuiora: oro ut cogitet nullam artem in litteris sine interprete et exercitatione percipi posse, nec longe exemplum abest: num ius civile aut canonicum ex libris cognosci potest? Qui quamque plurimi sunt, doctorem tamen unumque lumen desiderant: qui viva voce mentem auditorum aperiat et tunc ipsi auditores ex uno fonte hauriunt quantum cupiunt. (f. 2v) Tuo quippe prestantissimo ingenio nihil obscurum fieri potest(?) credo: cum te ita studiosum mortales predicent ut nullum omnino adolescentum vel etiam senum regali stirpe natorum eisdem studiis ferocius incumbentem opponere possimus: quem non videaris facile superare, in virtutibus quidem antistatum: et in prosa pia principatum talem obtines ut si velim insudando tuas depingere laudes: cicius earum multitudine audientum aures obtunderem: quodam(?) illas verbis exhaurire possem. Hoc unum profecto superest, quod cum ib his tibi majorem neque parem opponere possimus: fas erit te transhominem iudicare. Videas igitur hoc opusculum lucubratum meis nocturnis et Tholosanis vigilius. Nam quid aliud nunc pro servitio impendere possem nescio: pecuniis non indiges: nec gloria cares: sensu habundas, generatione humanos excellis, inclinatione scientie inter dignitatum cultores laudaris, igitur ipsum et me accipe: et pro tuo libito manda et rege. Datum Tholose die decimo May. Anno domini millesimo. CCCC LXXXVI.      |    To the most Reverend Father in Christ, the most illustrious lord Alfonso of Aragon, the most worthy Archbishop of Zaragoza: his humble subject, Guillermo Goris, after devoutly kissing your hands, humbly commends himself. Most Reverend Father in Christ, I am not unaware that, born of the most illustrious lineage, you have been advised by your general vicar, at your instigation, that I should write something from my modest moral studies for your dignity. Nor have I so forgotten your commands that, if I have long ceased writing, I might appear disobedient to your dignity. But if I had written sooner, I would not have done it carefully enough. Whatever I had intended to do, I decided to defer it to another time, both because of the length of time and because of lacking my own country. However, since to some the theological doctrine of Scotus seems not undeservedly subtle and obscure, the awareness of the respect owed to those who nourish us by nature, and indeed the deep recollection of your commands, have admonished me to no longer tolerate negligence. Thus, if I could not assist in one kind of writing, at least in another, I could offer utility to those and comply with your excellent dignity. For this reason, I have decided to draw this doctrine, like water from a well close to the dark and center of the earth, and to transfer it clearly to another shallow well. And, by divine grace, having finished it summarily, I send it to you, the most Reverend and illustrious bishop, whom I wish to read it so that you judge it as something slight and poor, not much worthy of being written. Indeed, to comply with your commands, I wanted to send you this little gift, woven with the coarse thread of speech, like a garment of little value, as is usual for my gifts. I hope indeed that your archiepiscopal and regal dignity, which all mortal men judge to be strong, just, severe, grave, magnanimous, generous, benevolent, and liberal, will not suffer the injury of being maligned by those who detract unjustly, if there be any such. Nor will there be anything else they might greatly criticize, if your intense pursuit of studies has found something crude and corrected it. But if any passages in this little work appear obscure to anyone, I ask them to consider that no art can be grasped without an interpreter and practice; and an example is not far off: can civil or canon law be known from books? Although there are many books, yet they require a single teacher and light to open the minds of their listeners with a living voice, and then the listeners themselves draw as much as they wish from a single source. Nothing can be obscure to your outstanding intellect, I believe, since mortals proclaim you so studious that there is no young or old man born of royal lineage who can be set against you in the same studies, whom you do not easily surpass. In virtues indeed you surpass all; and in holy prose, you hold such a preeminence that if I were to attempt to describe your praises by sweating over it, I would sooner dull the ears of my listeners with their multitude than exhaust them with my words. This one thing remains true: since we can set up neither a greater nor an equal against you in these things, it will be fair to judge you as beyond human. Therefore, see this little work composed in my nocturnal and Toulouse vigils. For I do not know what else I could now offer for your service: you are not in need of money, nor do you lack glory; you abound in wisdom, excel mankind in your lineage, and are praised among the cultivators of dignities for your inclination to knowledge. Therefore, receive this work and me, and at your pleasure, command and direct. Given at Toulouse, the tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord 1486.    |
