| Reverendissimo in Christo patri, et illustrissimo domino domino Alfonso de Aragonia archiepiscopo cesaragustanensis dignissimo: subditus Guillermus Goris, post devotissima manuum oscula se humilime commendat. Non sum nescius Reverendissime in Christo pater illustrissima prosapia natus: a tuo generali vicario, tui concitatione admonitum fuisse ut aliquid de meis moralibus studiolis pro tua dignitate scriberem. Nec ita preceptorum tuorum oblitus fui ut si diu scribendo cessaverim tue dignitati inobediens videret. Sed quod si cicius scripsissem illud satis diligenter non fecissem. Quodquod etiam facere constitueram: tum diuturnitate temporis: tum propria carens patria, in aliud tempus diferendum fore existimavi. Verumtamen cum nonnullis theologica Scoti doctrina non immerito subtilis et obscura videretur. Idcirco nedum eorum vulitas cui natura nos favere iubet: verum etiam tuorum preceptorum alta recordatio me admonuit ut pro fugata negligentia diucius non sustinerem: quin si non in uno scribendi genere saltem in alio illorum utilitati subvenirem: tueque excellenti dignitati obtemperarem, obquam rem doctrinam illam veluti aquam ab obscuro et centro terre proximo puteo exhauriendam: et in alium non profundum puteolum luculenter transferendam decrevi. Ipsamque divino munere sumulatim peractam: tibi reverendissimo et illustrissimo pontifici mitto: quam vellem sic legas: ut eam tenuem et inopem nec scriptione magnopere dignam iudices. Ego enim ut tuis preceptis morem geram: ad te mittere volui istud munusculum veluti vilis vestis crasso filo sermonis contextum: cujusmodi mea solent esse munera. Spero equidem tuam archiepiscopalem atque regalem dignitatem quam fortem, justam, severam, gravem magnanimam, largam, beneficam et liberalem omnes mortalium iudicant, non juste detrabentium (si qui sint) infamare injuriam. Nec erit preterea quod isti magnopere culpare possint, si tua ingens studiorum insectatio: quid(?) crassum invenerit castigaverit. Sinvero cuipiam  aliqua in ipso opusculo videbuntur obscuiora: oro ut cogitet nullam artem in litteris sine interprete et exercitatione percipi posse, nec longe exemplum abest: num ius civile aut canonicum ex libris cognosci potest? Qui quamque plurimi sunt, doctorem tamen unumque lumen desiderant: qui viva voce mentem auditorum aperiat et tunc ipsi auditores ex uno fonte hauriunt quantum cupiunt. (f. 2v) Tuo quippe prestantissimo ingenio nihil obscurum fieri potest(?) credo: cum te ita studiosum mortales predicent ut nullum omnino adolescentum vel etiam senum regali stirpe natorum eisdem studiis ferocius incumbentem opponere possimus: quem non videaris facile superare, in virtutibus quidem antistatum: et in prosa pia principatum talem obtines ut si velim insudando tuas depingere laudes: cicius earum multitudine audientum aures obtunderem: quodam(?) illas verbis exhaurire possem. Hoc unum profecto superest, quod cum ib his tibi majorem neque parem opponere possimus: fas erit te transhominem iudicare. Videas igitur hoc opusculum lucubratum meis nocturnis et Tholosanis vigilius. Nam quid aliud nunc pro servitio impendere possem nescio: pecuniis non indiges: nec gloria cares: sensu habundas, generatione humanos excellis, inclinatione scientie inter dignitatum cultores laudaris, igitur ipsum et me accipe: et pro tuo libito manda et rege. Datum Tholose die decimo May. Anno domini millesimo. CCCC LXXXVI. (f. 3r)     |    To the most Reverend Father in Christ, the most illustrious lord Alfonso of Aragon, the most worthy Archbishop of Zaragoza: his humble subject, Guillermo Goris, after devoutly kissing your hands, humbly commends himself. Most Reverend Father in Christ, I am not unaware that, born of the most illustrious lineage, you have been advised by your general vicar, at your instigation, that I should write something from my modest moral studies for your dignity. Nor have I so forgotten your commands that, if I have long ceased writing, I might appear disobedient to your dignity. But if I had written sooner, I would not have done it carefully enough. Whatever I had intended to do, I decided to defer it to another time, both because of the length of time and because of lacking my own country. However, since to some the theological doctrine of Scotus seems not undeservedly subtle and obscure, the awareness of the respect owed to those who nourish us by nature, and indeed the deep recollection of your commands, have admonished me to no longer tolerate negligence. Thus, if I could not assist in one kind of writing, at least in another, I could offer utility to those and comply with your excellent dignity. For this reason, I have decided to draw this doctrine, like water from a well close to the dark and center of the earth, and to transfer it clearly to another shallow well. And, by divine grace, having finished it summarily, I send it to you, the most Reverend and illustrious bishop, whom I wish to read it so that you judge it as something slight and poor, not much worthy of being written. Indeed, to comply with your commands, I wanted to send you this little gift, woven with the coarse thread of speech, like a garment of little value, as is usual for my gifts. I hope indeed that your archiepiscopal and regal dignity, which all mortal men judge to be strong, just, severe, grave, magnanimous, generous, benevolent, and liberal, will not suffer the injury of being maligned by those who detract unjustly, if there be any such. Nor will there be anything else they might greatly criticize, if your intense pursuit of studies has found something crude and corrected it. But if any passages in this little work appear obscure to anyone, I ask them to consider that no art can be grasped without an interpreter and practice; and an example is not far off: can civil or canon law be known from books? Although there are many books, yet they require a single teacher and light to open the minds of their listeners with a living voice, and then the listeners themselves draw as much as they wish from a single source. Nothing can be obscure to your outstanding intellect, I believe, since mortals proclaim you so studious that there is no young or old man born of royal lineage who can be set against you in the same studies, whom you do not easily surpass. In virtues indeed you surpass all; and in holy prose, you hold such a preeminence that if I were to attempt to describe your praises by sweating over it, I would sooner dull the ears of my listeners with their multitude than exhaust them with my words. This one thing remains true: since we can set up neither a greater nor an equal against you in these things, it will be fair to judge you as beyond human. Therefore, see this little work composed in my nocturnal and Toulouse vigils. For I do not know what else I could now offer for your service: you are not in need of money, nor do you lack glory; you abound in wisdom, excel mankind in your lineage, and are praised among the cultivators of dignities for your inclination to knowledge. Therefore, receive this work and me, and at your pleasure, command and direct. Given at Toulouse, the tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord 1486.    |

| Scotus pauperum in quod doctorum et Scoti opiniones in quatuor libris sententiarum contente dilucidantur. Tholose editus per eximium artium et sacre theologie professorem Guillermum Gorris Aragonensem ad pauperum utilitatem feliciter incipit. Quanquam componendi codices libera facultas in infinitium usque eorum numerum augeat. Attamen vetustissimorum sententias longo conflatu descriptas: cum earum non parva semita: Tum hominum presertim litteris vacantium etatis maturitate et vite naturalis fine preveniente. Tum non nullorum peregrinantium utilitate pensata. Tum etiam instigatione Reverendissimi in Christo pater, et illustrissimi domini ALfonsi de Aragonia Archiepiscopi cesaragustinensis, opere precum coagulandas fore existimavi. Eas ob res opinionum qui in quatuor libris subtilissimi sacre theologie doctoris sub quadam (ut ita dixerim) nube tradi videntur, proprios auxtores in medium producere mihi ipsi persuasi. Et omnium sententiarum extirpatis enigmatibus lapillos et flores. Citacorum vel apium more preeligendos(?) et in unum locum tanquam in alveum recondendos esse censui, ut quid nonnulli ob plurimorum librorum revolutionem: non parvo temporis spacio consequuntur, immo plerumque numquam ob eorum diffidenciam: aut vitam breviorem. Reliqui vero continuantes et praesertim peregrinantes uno libello ex pluribus redacto: eisdem preciosis mellifluisque sententiis haud multo tempore interjecto potiantur. Non enim in se parum fructus habent argumentorum conclusiones et sententiarum commode brevitates. Si alterum recta intelligentia, alterum diffinita animi comprehensione gubernetur. Nec vero haec arroganter dicta existimari velim. Nam cum philosophie et theologie scientiam multis concedam, et in eo studio etatem consumpserim. SI id mihi assumerem, viderer id ipsum meo jure quodammodo vendicare. Quamobrem magnopere opusculum istud legentes (3v) ortor ut si quid ibi preciosum invenerint, primo deo altissimo omnium rerum illuminator. Expostque reverendo magistro Johanni Scoto hujus divine sapientie clarificatori, necnon reverendissimo et illustrissimo Archiepiscopo prefato horum laborum stimulatori tribuendum recte putent. Quicquid autem erit reprehensione dignum insufficiencie meae ascribi velim. Cognoscende tamen veritatis affectus et non levis amor quem erga studium et hujus opusculi stimulatores gero quibus attrahor et absolute compellor manum ad calamum mittere vehementer in his me excusatum reddant. Non enim ad id spe questus aut gloria commotus accedo, sed ut industria mea (si ita loqui fas est) tanti maximi viri praecipue, hincque non nullorum animorum saciatos reddat. Laudantes igitur opusculum istud et melioribus rationibus roborantes vel etiam merito reprehendentes amplectar, detrahentibus autem non resistam, sed veluti agnus (ut ita dixerim) coram tondente positus non aperiam os meum. Nec enim praetermittam divini fovoris graciam invocare, ne prius ad humana quam divinia subsidia habeatur recursus. Idcirco ego Guillermus goris inter sacre pagine magistros licet minimus tum indignus: cupiens omnia ad laudem et gloriam dei omnipotentis: genitricisque virginis Marie tociusque curie celestis iniciari prosequi et finiri: flectendo genua et si non corporis saltem cordis ad deum inquantum possum humiles porrigo preces: ut non ponderatis humanis demeritis: ejus sola in finita clementia in me graciam suam influat, scientie et eloquentie de fectum suppleat: ingenii modulum et memorie quantitatem augeat ut possim doctrine Scoti compendiose veritatem pandere: errores fugare: enigmata reserare: nodos solvere, obscura dilucidare et dubia declarare, utque sic plantetur edificetur roboretur et conservetur sacratissima scientia in mentibus desideratium auditorum et inde ditiora et bonorificentiora sint corpora: eorumque mentes sancte exortationi facilius incubant, sic que erducite sint anime et a deo picte multisque virtutibus indute ut beatitudinem mereantur. Sit autem hoc opus exquisitum memoriale provectis, maturari incipientibus, medium ad finem intentum cicius consequendum iuvenibus viam prebens, et desides excusso negligentie et diffidentie somno assiduos et vigilantes erga studium reddat, ut sermo meus cintillam amoris hujus scientie in eis inveniens: in illam influat eamque nutriat: et cum creverit flammam dignissimam faciat. Et licet dicta mea a recto tramite doctrine scoti tanquam illi submissa non deviare putem. Attamen filiali obedientia correctioni et emende prefati (4r) Reverendissimi et illustrissimi domini archiepiscopi, necnon cujuslibet melius me sentientis. Et praecipue sancte Romane ecclesie que omnium fidelium mater etiam et magistra: subicio et vere profiteor me id solum tenere quid ipsa aprobat. Si qua tamen in hoc opusculo catholicis sententius obvient ut reprehensionis notam evitare possum: jam nunc ab animo mente et libro deleo atque deleri volo. Verum mihi (prout maximo legum latori) visum fuit indecorum esse hujus operis de nominatione et origine non repetita: protinus constitutam materiam aggredi. Nam iste prefationes libentius nos ad lectionem proposite materie perducunt: et cum ibi venerimus eius evidentiorem prestant intellectum. Necessario igitur mihi videtur in primis hujus opusculi originem et nomen demonstrare. Et quidem cum omnium quatuor librorum scoti expolitas sententias hic recollexerim absque medio hunc rivulum ab illo (veluti a fonte) originem ducere censeo. Ideo ipsius nomen non mihi vendicandum sed ipsi Scoto tribuendum puto, eritque ejus epigrama Scotus pauperum, nam pauperes facilius cum eo scotizabunt. At divisionem operis non taceam. Animum enim legentis incitat: mentem intelligentis preparat et memoriam artificiose reformat. Et quidem in qualibet quaestione talem servabo ordinem. Primo doctorum opiniones recitabo ex quibus Scotum legentibus via aperitur. Secundo doctoris subul(?) opinionem per quam vera theologia demonstratur. Tertio doctoris subulitates per quas quicunque intelligens subtilis appelatur. Sed in recitatione opinionum secutus sum articulos scoti ut qui cunque lector cognoscat ubi opinioni ipsa tangitur et a quo doctore quam in Scoto articuli inveniantur eos descripsi. Haecque ideo feci ut facilius materia enucleari posset: et studentes quorum multus amor me sollicitum reddit cicius scotizarent. Summa autem divisio tocius presentis operis prout a Scoto traditur haec est. Nam cum quatuor sint libri. In primo tangitur mira preclaritas divini generis scilicet origo filii a patre et spiritus sancti abutroque. In secundo mira varietas producti operis scilicet novus exitus creature a suo creatore. In tertio mira benignitas uniti federis scilicet unio dei et hominis in nostro redemptore. In quarto mira utilitas impensi muneris scilicet gracie date in sacramentorum administratione vel susceptione, et glorificatio anime et corporis in beata resurrectione. (4v) | Scotus pauperum, in which the opinions of the learned Doctor Scotus contained in the four books of Sentences are elucidated, happily begins, composed at Toulouse by the distinguished professor of arts and sacred theology, Guillermo Gorris of Aragon, for the benefit of the poor. Although the free ability to compose books can increase their number infinitely, nevertheless, the sentences of the most ancient ones, inscribed through long endeavors—due to the not insignificant path of them, the advancing age and the natural end of life of those, especially those engaged in letters, and the considered usefulness of some travelers—, and also through the instigation of the Most Reverend Father in Christ and most illustrious Lord Alfonso of Aragon, Archbishop of Zaragoza, I have deemed it necessary to compile these works. For these reasons, I have persuaded myself to bring to light the opinions that seem to be transmitted under a certain cloud (so to speak) in the four books of the most subtle Doctor of Sacred Theology, to present their original authors. And I have decided that, with all the riddles of the sentences cleared away, the stones and flowers of the citations, chosen like the manner of bees, ought to be gathered and stored in one place as in a hive, so that what some achieve after the perusal of many books over a not insignificant span of time—or, indeed, often never achieve due to their despair or a shorter life span—others who are diligent, especially travelers, might obtain the same precious and honey-sweet sentences in little time from a single book compiled from many. For there is not little fruit in the conclusions of arguments and the convenient brevity of sentences, provided one is governed by correct understanding in one respect, and by a defined comprehension of the mind in the other. I do not wish this to be thought arrogantly spoken, for I grant the science of philosophy and theology to many, and I have spent my age in that study. If I were to assume this for myself, I would seem to claim it by my right in some way. Therefore, I earnestly urge those reading this little work that, if they find anything precious therein, they should first give thanks to the most high God, the illuminator of all things. And afterward, they should rightly attribute this work to the Reverend Master John Scotus, the clarifier of this divine wisdom, as well as to the Most Reverend and Illustrious Archbishop previously mentioned, the encourager of these labors. However, whatever may be deemed worthy of criticism, I would like it to be attributed to my inadequacy. The sincere desire to know the truth and the genuine love for the study and the encouragers of this work, which draw me and compel me absolutely to put pen to paper, should strongly excuse me in these matters.  For I do not undertake this work with the hope of gain or glory but rather that my efforts (if it is right to speak so) might satisfy the minds of this most distinguished man and some others. Thus, I will welcome those who praise this little work and strengthen it with better reasons, or even rightly criticize it. To the detractors, I will not resist, but like a lamb (if I may say so) placed before its shearer, I will not open my mouth. Nor will I fail to invoke the grace of divine favor, so that recourse is not made to human rather than divine help first. Therefore, I, Guillermo Goris, among the masters of the sacred page, though the least and unworthy, wishing that all things be initiated, pursued, and concluded to the praise and glory of Almighty God, of the Virgin Mary, and of the entire heavenly court, humbly extend, as much as I can, my prayers to God, bending my knees, if not in body, at least in spirit: that He, not considering human merits, but solely by His infinite mercy, may pour His grace upon me, supply for the deficiency of knowledge and eloquence, increase the measure of my intellect and memory, so that I may be able to expound succinctly the truth of Scotus's doctrine, dispel errors, unlock enigmas, solve difficulties, clarify the obscure, and explain the doubtful. Thus, may the most sacred knowledge be planted, built up, strengthened, and preserved in the minds of eager listeners, so that their bodies may be enriched and honored, and their minds may more easily incline to holy exhortation, and so that their souls, led forth and adorned by God and endowed with many virtues, may deserve blessedness.  Let this chosen work serve as a memorial for the advanced, a means for those beginning to mature, a path for the youth to achieve their intended goal more swiftly, and let it awaken the idle from the sleep of negligence and distrust, making them diligent and attentive towards study, so that my discourse, finding a spark of love for this knowledge in them, may flow into it, nourish it, and, as it grows, make it a most worthy flame. And although I think my words do not deviate from the straight path of Scotus's doctrine, being submitted to it, I nonetheless submit with filial obedience to the correction and amendment of the aforementioned Most Reverend and Illustrious Lord Archbishop, and also of anyone else who may think better than I do. And especially to the Holy Roman Church, the mother and teacher of all the faithful, I submit myself and truly profess that I hold only what she approves. However, if anything in this little work is contrary to Catholic teachings, so that I may avoid the mark of censure, I now erase and desire to have it erased from my mind, heart, and book. Indeed, it seemed improper to me (just as it would to the greatest lawgiver) to immediately proceed to the established subject of this work without first revisiting its title and origin. For these prefaces more willingly lead us to the reading of the proposed subject matter, and when we arrive there, they provide a clearer understanding. Therefore, it seems necessary to me, first of all, to demonstrate the origin and name of this little work. Indeed, since I have gathered here the refined teachings of all four books of Scotus without an intermediary, I consider that this little stream derives its origin from that source (as from a fountain). Therefore, I believe the name itself should not be claimed by me, but rather attributed to Scotus himself, and its title will be "Scotus Pauperum," as the poor will find it easier to "scotize" with him. But let me not be silent about the division of the work, for it incites the reader's spirit, prepares the mind of the understanding, and skillfully reformats memory. And indeed, in each question, I will follow such an order. First, I will recount the opinions of the doctors from whom the way is opened for the readers to Scotus. Second, I will provide the subtle opinion of the doctor, through which true theology is demonstrated. Third, I will present the subtleties of the doctor, by which anyone understanding them is called subtle. However, in recounting the opinions, I have followed Scotus’s articles so that any reader may know where each opinion is touched upon, and by which doctor these are found in Scotus's articles. I have done this so that the material may be more easily unraveled and that students, whose great love makes me anxious, may "scotize" more quickly. The overall division of the entire present work, as handed down by Scotus, is as follows. For, as there are four books: in the first, the wondrous clarity of the divine origin is discussed, namely, the origin of the Son from the Father and the Holy Spirit from both. In the second, the wondrous diversity of the created work is discussed, namely, the new creation emerging from its Creator. In the third, the wondrous benevolence of the united covenant is discussed, namely, the union of God and man in our Redeemer. In the fourth, the wondrous utility of the imparted gift is discussed, namely, the grace given in the administration or reception of the sacraments, and the glorification of the soul and body in the blessed resurrection.     |
