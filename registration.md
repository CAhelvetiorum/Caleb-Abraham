# Registration

Registration is now closed.

### Attendance in person in Geneva

Prior to the conference, you will receive an invitation to register in the UN visitor system. If you do not already have a United Nations badge, you must complete a registration form for the security service (registered participants will receive a mail a few days before the conference with instructions).

More information on the exact location will be provided on the "[practical information](https://intellectualcooperation.org/informations)" page and via email.

### Online participation

Prior to the conference, you will receive instructions to connect to the Webex interface. You can already make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest version of the software (Cisco Webex Meeting: https://www.webex.com/downloads.html). During the conference, you will be able to ask your questions to the speakers through an app that will be available in the Webex chat. Don't hesitate to participate!
