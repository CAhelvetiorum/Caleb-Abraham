I am a Swiss academic historian of the late medieval and early modern periods. My fields of expertise are science (medicine and physics), religion (practice, materiality, theology), and universities. I have combined various approaches, such as that of intellectual history, cultural history, micro-history, and biography.

This website presents my past and present areas of inquiry.
